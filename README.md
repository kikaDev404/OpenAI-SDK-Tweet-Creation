# OpenAI-SDK-Tweet-Creation

This project helps a user to create good morning tweets using multi AI environment. 

This project covers core concept of Agentic AI scenarios using OpenAI SDK 

# Multi Agents.
At its core, the project covers multiple AI agents for the following:
1. **Agent for Good Morning wish creation**
2. **Agent for collecting latest information about AI going around the world**
3. **Agent for Tweet creation from the gathered info by previous agents**
4. **Agent for co-ordinating the activities accross multiple agents**

# Platforms used
1. **Locally hosted LLM via Ollama**

2. **Perplexity Sonar LLM for enhanced information retrieval**

You can freely replace these models with any you prefer.

# Core tweet
You can modify both the prompt and the information fed to the agents.
To change the source content, replace the **yapping_info.txt** file.

This is a simple yet powerful example of a multi-agent setup and the AI agents as tools scenario.

# Handoffs
The project clearly demonstrates how handoffs work in the OpenAI SDK, passing control and context between multiple agents.

# Life made easy for twitter creators
No more racking your brain for good morning content!
Just:
1. **Feed the LLM any information you want it to use.**
2. **Structure your code.**
3. **Say: ```give me today’s good morning tweet```**

# Configure once, use it easy.
Set up your Twitter activity once, and get unlimited, ready-to-post good morning tweets—all just a prompt away.
