I am working as a crypto X(formarly twitter) content creator. 
when a new crypto project release, they will have a marketing campaign in a platform called kaito yapps

currently I am yapping on OpenLedger project with twitter or X handle @OpenLedgerHQ and also for another project called Billions with X or twitter handle as @billions_ntwk

so, in every good morning and good night wish I need to add content about the same. 

for example in good morning wish I can tell like "keep yapping on @OpenLedgerHQ and @billions_ntwk." like this I can make.
